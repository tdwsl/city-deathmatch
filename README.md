ABOUT

This is a simple 2-player game about shooting each other and (with limited
success) running each other over. It includes a built in level editor. It was
made with the Free Pascal Compiler and the Allegro.pas wrapper for Allegro 5.

CONTROLS

To control player one, the keys are WSAD to move, 1 to switch to shooting mode
or to get out of a vehicle. When in shooting mode, the player moves with tank
controls. Press 1 again to switch out of shooting mode, or 2 to shoot. The
controls for player 2 are the same but with the arrow keys, comma, and period
instead of WSAD, 1 and 2. The game also includes an editor. To enter the it,
press equals. The controls for the editor are shown once in it.

COMPILING

To compile this game, you will need Free Pascal, Allegro 5 and Allegro.pas.
Windows users are recommended to download the pre-built binaries for
Allegro.pas instead of compiling from source. Put the folder containing the
Allegro.pas wrapper in the directory above the folder containing the code, the
C: drive, or the user's home directory. Both Linux and windows users can
compile with simply "fpc allegro.pas", or for Linux users there are some very
simple scripts.
